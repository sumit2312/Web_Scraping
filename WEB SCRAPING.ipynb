      "Our film company is looking to show (or hopefully seemlessly link to) our 25 minute long film from our own website (ideally) where we want to add extras like outtakes and trivia about the film. We would also like to charge just a couple bucks and give the viewer access to the film (even if actual film served from probably another film-dedicated site) for 24 or so hours (to the viewer/visitor).\n",

      "***** We realize that hosting your own film on your standard web host (blue host, hostgator, etc) is difficult in terms of bandwidth and other tech factors, so we acknowledge that we will have to link/serve the film from a site dedicated to serving up & protecting video If you know how we couldlink this to a dedicated film host or another film site - and make this the smoothest transition possible with the link from our site. We realize we my have to send the viewer/visitor away from our site, but it would be ideal if we didn't have to.\n",

      "1) A decent-looking web site for our film - about 3 pages - a) feature page for our 24 -hr restriced access film. b) Extra features c) Contact us page\n",

      "2) A smooth way to link up to our film to a site that hosts and protects films (we realize that we will have to serve the film from another site dedicated to serving up & protecting films to avoid tech issues) If we can make this link up seemless, without visitors completely navigating away from our site forever it would be ideal.\n",
